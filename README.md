# Weatherpy
Weather Analysis
Here we are creating a Python Script to

Randomly select longitude and latitude and use Citipy library and get 500 + unique cities
Using Openweathermap API to get the weather conditions for these 500+ cities.
Using this data Analyse and plot how the following parameters vary with latitude :
      i)  Max temperature
      ii) Cloudiness 
     iii) Wind 
      iv) Humidity
Observation :
As expected, the weather becomes significantly warmer as one approaches the equator (0 Deg. Latitude). More interestingly, however, is the fact that the southern hemisphere tends to be warmer this time of year than the northern hemisphere. This may be due to the tilt of the earth.
There is no strong relationship between latitude and cloudiness. However, it is interesting to see that a strong band of cities sits at 0, 80, and 100% cloudiness.

There is no strong relationship between latitude and wind speed. However, in northern hemispheres there is a flurry of cities with over 20 mph of wind.
